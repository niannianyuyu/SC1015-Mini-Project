# HEART ATTACK RISK PREDICTION IN INDONESIAN ADULTS
by Chong Xin Yi (U2430538H) and Lim Yi Yang (U2430620B)
## ABOUT

Our mini-project focuses on identifying the main lifestyle habits and clinical risk factors that cause heart attacks, and to build a predictive model to help people identify the probabilty of them being at risk to heart attack. To aid in our project, we have used a dataset from kaggle. The link to the dataset would be attached below.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION

Objective : To identify which lifestyle and clinical risk factor best predict heart attacks amongst adults in Indonesia

Motivation : Understanding the most critical risk factors can aid in preventive healthcare measures, improving public health outcomes in Indonesia

Research Questions : 

- Which factors are most correlated with heart attcks?

- Can we build a reliable predictive model?

- What actionable insights can be drawn from the analysis?

## Ecploratory Data Analysis ( EDA ) :

For numeric data :

- Violin plot

- Histogram

For categorical data :

- Countplot

- Heatmap

### How we analysised 

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

- Separation Score

- Chi-Square Test

## Machine Learning Modeling :

- Decision tree

- CatBoost Classifier

## Some interesting things we learned :

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

- Separation Score

- CatBoost Classifier

## Data-Driven Insights and Reccomendations :

Age is a Major Predictor

- Older individuals, especially those above 63.5, showed a significantly higher risk of heart attacks.

High Cholesterol and Hypertension Are Critical Risk Factors

- Individuals with high cholesterol and high blood pressure had a much higher likelihood of having a heart attack.

Smoking Status Matters

- Smokers were significantly more likely to experience heart attacks compared to non-smokers.

Physical Inactivity & Obesity (if in your data)

- Lack of physical activity and elevated BMI were associated with increased heart attack risk.

CatBoost Model Revealed Hidden Patterns

- Using CatBoost, we identified non-linear relationships between features like resting ECG results and target outcomes that wouldn’t have been obvious in basic analysis.

## Takeaways :

These insights aren’t just numbers — they point toward real, preventive actions we can take:

- Focus screening efforts on adults aged 63.5 and above

- Run targeted anti-smoking campaigns

- Educate the public on managing cholesterol and blood pressure

By applying these findings, we can design smarter prevention strategies and more effectively reach high-risk groups, ultimately reducing the burden of heart disease across Indonesia
